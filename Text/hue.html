<h4> Hue </h4>

<p>In its simplest form, hue is a color wheel where each color is a number between 0 and 360 degrees.</p> 

<p>Hue does not take into account how dark, intense, or light the color is. It is solely a representation of a color.</p> 

<p>Amongst the foundation shades, hue values never passes 45 because that is when hue starts venturing away from the color yellow and into green. And who wants green foundation?</p>
