<h4>Brightness represents, for lack of a better word, the brightness of the color.</h4>

<p>Brightness values range from 0 to 100%. Brightness interacts with saturation to represent a color. A color with 0% brightness is black, but a color with 100% brightness is the brightest form of the color. The only exception is if the saturation is at 0%, then the color is just white. </p>

<p>Brightness aligns with how one traditionally think of foundation shades. The foundation shades with the lowest percentage of brightness are also the darkest foundation shades.</p>
